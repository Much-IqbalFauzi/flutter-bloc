# bloc_vanilla

A simple Flutter project for learning BloC Pattern.

## Getting Started

### What is Bloc?

Business logic components (BLoC) allow you to separate the business logic from the UI. Writing code in BLoC makes it easier to write and reuse tests.

In simple terms, BLoC accepts a stream of events, processes the data based on events, and produces the output as states.
